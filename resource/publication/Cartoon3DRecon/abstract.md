This work introduces a novel framework to generate animatable 3D cartoon faces from a single portrait image. We first transfer an input real-world portrait to a stylized cartoon image with a StyleGAN, then we propose a two-stage reconstruction method to recover the 3D cartoon face with detailed texture. Our two-stage strategy first makes a coarse estimation based on template models, and then refines the model by non-rigid deformation under landmark supervision. Finally, we design a semantic preserving face rigging method based on manually created templates and deformation transfer. Compared with prior arts, qualitative and quantitative results show that our method achieves better accuracy, aesthetics, and similarity criteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of real-time facial animation of our 3D model.
