In this work, we create a novel RGB-D dataset, called Digital-Twin Tracking Dataset (DTTD), to enable further research of the 3D object tracking problem and extend potential solutions towards longer ranges and mm localization accuracy. To reduce point cloud noise from the input source, we select the latest Microsoft Azure Kinect as the state-of-the-art time-of-flight (ToF) camera. In total, 103 scenes of 10 common off-the-shelf objects with rich textures are recorded, with each frame annotated with a per-pixel semantic segmentation and ground-truth object poses provided by a commercial motion capturing system. Through experiments, we demonstrate that DTTD can help researchers develop future object tracking methods and analyze new challenges.
