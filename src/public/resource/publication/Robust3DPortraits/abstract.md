We propose an efficient method for robust 3D self-portraits using a single RGBD camera. Benefiting from the proposed PIFusion and lightweight bundle adjustment algorithm, our method can generate detailed 3D self-portraits in seconds and shows the ability to handle extremely loose clothes. To achieve highly efficient and robust reconstruction, we contribute PIFusion, which combines learning-based 3D recovery with volumetric non-rigid fusion to generate accurate sparse partial scans of the performer.
